# Workshop #3: Member Functions and Privacy

In this workshop, you will use member functions, privacy, safe empty state and formatting the output to complete your work.


## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this workshop, you will have demonstrated the abilities to:

- to define a class type
- to privatize data within the class type
- to instantiate an object of class type
- to access data within an object of class type through public member functions
- to use standard library facilities to format data inserted into the output stream
- to describe to your instructor what you have learned in completing this workshop


## General Instructions

### Submission Policy

This workshop is divided into two coding parts and one non-coding part.

- **Part 1** (*LAB*): A *step-by-step* guided workshop, worth 50% of the workshop's total mark.
  Please note that the part 1 section is **not to be started in your first session of the week**. You should start it on your own before the day of your class and join the first session of the week to ask for help and correct your mistakes (if there are any).
- **Part 2** (*DIY*): A *do-it-yourself* type of workshop that is much more open-ended and is worth 50% of the workshop's total mark.  
- **reflection**: non-coding part. The reflection doesn't have marks associated with it but can incur a **penalty of max 40% of the whole workshop's mark** if your professor deems it insufficient (you make your marks from the code, but you can lose some on the reflection).
  - Workshops that do not contain the *reflection* (that is the **non-coding part**) are considered incomplete and are ignored.



### Due Dates

The due dates depend on your section. Please choose the `-due` option of the submitter program to see the exact due date of your section:

```bash
~profname.proflastname/submit 2??/wX/pY_sss -due
~profname.proflastname/submit 2??/wX/reflect_sss -due
```

- Replace `??` with your subject code (`00` or `44`)
- Replace `X` with workshop number: [`1` to `10`]
- Replace `Y` with the part number: [`1` or `2`]
- Replace `sss` with the section identifier: [`naa`, `nbb`, `nra`, `zaa`, etc.]



### Late penalties

You are allowed to submit your work up to 2 days after the due date with 30% penalty for each day. After that, the submission will be closed, and the mark will be zero. If the reflection is missing when the submission closes, the mark for the whole workshop will be set to 0 (**including for the parts that were successfully submitted**).


### Citation

Every file that you submit must contain (as a comment) at the top:

- **your name**,
- **your Seneca email**,
- **Seneca Student ID**,
- the **date** when you completed the work.


#### For work that is done entirely by you (ONLY YOU)

If the file contains only your work or the work provided to you by your professor, add the following message as a comment at the top of the file:

> I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.


#### For work that is done partially by you

If the file contains work that is not yours (you found it online or somebody provided it to you), **write exactly which part of the assignment is given to you as help, who gave it to you, or which source you received it from**.  By doing this you will only lose the mark for the parts you got help for, and the person helping you will be clear of any wrongdoing.

- Add the citation to the file in which you have the borrowed code (make sure to clearly mark the code that is not created by you and where did you got it from).
- In the `reflect.txt` file, add a summary of the files/portions of code that is not yours (the source files should un-ambiguously identify the portions of code that are not yours).

> :warning: This [Submission Policy](#submission-policy) only applies to the workshops. All other assessments in this subject have their own submission policies.


#### If you have helped someone with your code

If you have helped someone with your code, let them know of these regulations and, in your `reflect.txt` file, write exactly which part of your code was copied and who was the recipient of this code. By doing this you will be clear of any wrongdoing if the recipient of the code does not honour these regulations.


### Compiling and Testing Your Program

All your code should be compiled using this command on `matrix`:

```bash
g++ -Wall -std=c++11 -g -o ws file1.cpp file2.cpp ...
```

- `-Wall`: the compiler will report all warnings
- `-std=c++11`: the code will be compiled using the C++11 standard
- `-g`: the executable file will contain debugging symbols, allowing *valgrind* to create better reports
- `-o ws`: the compiled application will be named `ws`

After compiling and testing your code, run your program as follows to check for possible memory leaks (assuming your executable name is `ws`):

```bash
valgrind --show-error-list=yes --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes ws
```

- `--show-error-list=yes`: show the list of detected errors
- `--leak-check=full`: check for all types of memory problems
- `--show-leak-kinds=all`: show all types of memory leaks identified (enabled by the previous flag)
- `--track-origins=yes`: tracks the origin of uninitialized values (`g++` must use `-g` flag for compilation, so the information displayed here is meaningful).

To check the output, use a program that can compare text files.  Search online for such a program for your platform, or use *diff* available on `matrix`.

> Note: All the code written in workshops and the project must be implemented in the **sdds** namespace, unless instructed otherwise.




## Part 1 (50%)

> Note: In this and future documents a **member function** may be referred to as a **method** and a **member variable** may be referred to as an **attribute**.

Your task for this part of the workshop is to create a program that provides a class called `Bill`, managing a collection of shopping items (objects of type `Item`).

Items will be added to the bill one at a time by their name, the price, and whether they are taxable or not.

The bill can be displayed, listing all the items in a tabular format. At the end of the list, a summary of the prices will be printed.


### The `Item` Module

Implement this module in two files:

- the header `Item.h` containing the `Item` class and global constants definitions.
- the source code file `Item.cpp` containing the implementation for all member functions in `Item` class.

Your task for this module is to create the module, add the global constants to the header, define the class `Item`, and implement the member functions according to the specs below.

***Global Constatnts***

```cpp
/// <summary>
/// An integer representing the number of characters
///   of the `NAME` column (used in printing to screen).
/// </summary>
??? WIDTH_NAME  = 32;

/// <summary>
/// An integer representing the number of characters
///   of the `PRICE` column (used in printing to screen).
/// </summary>
??? WIDTH_PRICE =  8;

/// <summary>
/// An integer representing the number of characters
///   of the `TAX` column (used in printing to screen).
/// </summary>
??? WIDTH_TAX   =  4;
```


***Private Members in Class `Item`***

```cpp
/// <summary>
/// The name of the item.
/// </summary>
// TODO: declare the `m_name` attribute; a statically-allocated
///        array with `WIDTH_NAME` characters (not counting the
///        null terminator).

/// The price of the item, not including tax.
/// </summary>
// TODO: declare the `m_price` attribute as a floating-point
//         number in double precision.

/// <summary>
/// `true` is the tax should be applied to this item when
///   calculating the total price.
/// </summary>
// TODO: declare the `m_isTaxed` attribute as a boolean flag.
```


***Public Members in Class `Item`***

```cpp
/// <summary>

### `billTester` Module

This module is already provided. Look at it, make sure you understand it, but do not change it.


### Submission

Upload the header files (`*.h`), source code files (`*.cpp`), and the data files (`*.csv`) to your `matrix` account. Compile and run your code using the `g++` compiler as shown above and make sure that everything works properly.

Then, run the following command from your matrix account

```bash
~profname.proflastname/submit 2??/wX/pY_sss
```

- Replace `??` with your subject code (`00` or `44`)
- Replace `X` with workshop number: [`1` to `10`]
- Replace `Y` with the part number: [`1` or `2`]
- Replace `sss` with the section: [`naa`, `nbb`, `nra`, `zaa`, etc.]
and follow the instructions.

> **Important:** Please note that a successful submission does not guarantee full credit for this workshop. If the professor is not satisfied with your implementation, your professor may ask you to resubmit. Re-submissions will attract a penalty.





## Part 2 (50%)

Write a **Daily Calorie Report** program that manages a collection of food items, their calorie numbers, and when they were consumed. There are four options for the time of the food consumption:

| When      | Code|
|-----------|-----|
| Breakfast |   1 |
| Lunch     |   2 |
| Dinner    |   3 |
| Snack     |   4 |

The program should report the list of the foods in a table format as shown in the sample output:

- the `FOOD NAME` column is 30 characters wide
- the `CALORIES` column is 4 characters wide
- the `WHEN` column is 10 characters wide

Note that in the output table there is a space between the border and the column content. The invalid food items should be filling all columns with `x`.

Your task is to implement two modules:

- `Food`: stores information about a single food item on the list.  This custom type should contain at least the following attributes:
  - a name as a C-string of 30 characters (statically-allocated). **Valid Value**: any not-null and not-empty string.
  - the number of calories as an integer. **Valid Value**: any integer greater than 0 and smaller or equal to 3000.
  - a field to store when this food is consumed (see the table above). You can choose any type you believe is appropriate for this attribute. **Valid Value**: only what is in the table above.
- `CalorieList`: manages a *dynamically-allocated array* of objects of type `Food`, and prints it to the screen as shown in the sample output.

Your solution should contain at least the following public members in the custom type `CalorieList`:

```cpp
/// <summary>
/// Initializes the list to be able to store `capacity` objects of type `Food`.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="capacity">An integer representing the maximum number of
///   items this list can accommodate.
/// 
///   **Valid capacity**: any number bigger than 0.</param>
init(capacity)

/// <summary>
/// Add a new food to the list, if there is capacity.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="food_name">A C-string containing the name of the food item.</param>
/// <param name="calories">An integer storing how many calories the food has.</param>
/// <param name="when">An integer representing when this food will be consumed.</param>
/// <returns>`true` if the food has been added to the list, `false` otherwise.</returns>
add(food_name, calories, when)

/// <summary>
/// Prints to screen the content of the list.  Look in the sample output
///   for hints about formatting.
/// </summary>
display()

/// <summary>
/// Deallocates all dynamic memory used by this object and sets all attributes to
///   a default value.
/// </summary>
reset()
```

As general guidelines, consider the following when designing your solution:

- do not add global variables/functions, unless specifically instructed to do so.  Global constants are acceptable.
- add as many private members as your design requires.
- all attributes in a class must be private, unless specifically instructed otherwise.
- all member functions should be queries, unless the needs of the project require otherwise.
- all member functions should be private, unless the needs of the project require otherwise.
- all public functions must validate their parameters before working with them (don't trust that clients provide good values).
- all parameters passed by-address or by-reference should be constants, unless the needs of the code require otherwise.

***You may freely use/copy any logic or code needed from the PART 1!***  You must use *custom types*, *public*/*private members*, and *dynamic memory allocation*.



### Submission

To test and demonstrate execution of your program use the same data as shown in the sample output.

Upload the header files (`*.h`), source code files (`*.cpp`), and the data files (`*.csv`) to your `matrix` account. Compile and run your code using the `g++` compiler as shown above and make sure that everything works properly:

- `Food.h`
- `Food.cpp`
- `CalorieList.h`
- `CalorieList.cpp`
- `calorieListTester.cpp`

Compile and run your code using the `g++` compiler as shown above and make sure that everything works properly. A sample run can be found in the file `output_sample.txt`.

Then, run the following command from your matrix account:

```bash
~profname.proflastname/submit 2??/wX/pY_sss
```

- Replace `??` with your subject code (`00` or `44`)
- Replace `X` with workshop number: [`1` to `10`]
- Replace `Y` with the part number: [`1` or `2`]
- Replace `sss` with the section identifier: [`naa`, `nbb`, `nra`, `zaa`, etc.]

and follow the instructions.


> **:warning:Important:** Please note that a successful submission does not guarantee full credit for this workshop. If the professor is not satisfied with your implementation, your professor may ask you to resubmit. Re-submissions will attract a penalty.




## Reflection

Study your final solutions for each deliverable of the workshop, reread the related parts of the course notes, and make sure that you have understood the concepts covered by this workshop.  **This should take no less than 30 minutes of your time and the result is suggested to be at least 150 words in length.**

Create a file named `reflect.txt` that contains your detailed description of the topics that you have learned in completing this workshop and mention any issues that caused you difficulty.

To avoid deductions, refer to code in your solution as examples to support your explanations. You may be asked to talk about your reflection (as a presentation) in class.
