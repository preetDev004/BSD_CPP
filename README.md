# BSD_CPP - C++ Course Repository (BTP200)


## Overview

Welcome to the BTP200 repository! This repository documents my journey through the Bachelor of Software Development program at Seneca College, particularly focusing on the BTP200 course. Throughout BTP200, I delved deep into the world of C++ programming, mastering its concepts, and culminating in the creation of a comprehensive Library Management project.

## Course Highlights

In this course, I gained valuable knowledge and skills, including:

- **C++ Proficiency:** I acquired a strong command of the C++ programming language, enabling me to develop robust and efficient code.

- **Problem Solving:** BTP200 presented me with various complex problems, pushing me to create innovative algorithms and solutions for real-world scenarios.

- **Project Development:** The Library Management project was the pinnacle of my C++ programming journey, allowing me to apply my skills to create a practical and functional solution.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- **Workshops 1-10:** The ten workshops that I completed during the course. Each workshop is tailored to address different aspects and concepts of C++ programming and problem-solving.

- **Milestones 1-5:** The five significant milestones/parts achieved in the Library Management project. Each milestone contains perticular aspact of the project, from creating the boiler plate with Date module to fully CRUD LibApp module.
